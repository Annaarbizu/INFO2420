	<h2>Website Critique - Trader Joe's</h2>
	<h4><a href="https://www.traderjoes.com">www.traderjoes.com</a></h4>
	
	<ol>
			<li>My first impression of the Trader Joes website was that it looked really clean and simple.The colors were neutral and not to bright, which made it feel calm and easy to look at.</li>
			
			<li>The Trader Joe’s site organizes information really well. The links are on the left side, and they’re easy to click and understand. I could get to the pages I wanted without any trouble.</li>
			
			<li>The structure of the site makes a lot of sense to me. Nothing felt confusing, and it was easy to move through the different sections without getting lost.</li>  
			
			<li>The graphics on the Trader Joe’s website definitely enhance the site. Everything looks clean and inviting, and it actually made me feel like I’d want to grocery shop at Trader Joes.</li>
			
			<li>The trader Joes website loaded pretty quickly I would say the load time was reasonable.</li>
			
			<li>The text color and size were very readable. It wasn’t too much or too little—it felt just right. There was also a photo for the 17th Annual Customer Choice Awards with a trophy, and it stood out in a good way and caught my attention.</li>
			
			<li>Yes, the site had a navigation bar, and I thought the navigation was done really well. Everything was easy to find.</li>
			
			<li>Yes, the site used a consistent color scheme and overall look on every page I clicked on, which made everything feel connected.</li>
			
			<li>The Trader Joe’s site responds well to smaller window sizes. I could still see everything clearly, and nothing got cut off or became hard to read. I was still able to navigate wherever I needed to go.</li>
			
			<li>One thing I thought was really cool was that when I hovered over a photo on the homepage, a little box popped up describing what was happening in the picture. It felt thoughtful because it helps people who can’t see the image clearly still understand what’s being shown.</li>
